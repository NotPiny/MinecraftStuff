# ![Pack.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NotPiny/MinecraftStuff/master/1.17.1/Resource%20packs/Utility/Fake%20items/pack.png) **Fake items**

***Optifine required***
<br>
<br>
The fake items resource pack adds fake items into the game so items like paper can be turned into others by naming them. The reason i made this pack is actually because i needed to put netherite into a item frame to farm my chests but i didnt have any netherite so i decided to make a pack to fix that. I hope you enjoy this pack and if you have any suggestions create a issue with the suggestion tag.
